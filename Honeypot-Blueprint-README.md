# Honeypot Blueprint  
_Deception Strategy & Deployment Guide_

---

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains the **‚ÄúHoneypot Blueprint‚Äù** deck, which outlines a structured approach to designing, selecting, and implementing deception technologies for a client organization. The guide serves as a reference for security teams, consultants, and architects involved in deception planning and execution.

- **Honeypot-Blueprint.pptx**  
  The PowerPoint presentation covers:

  1. **Introduction & Objectives**  
     - Purpose and scope of deception engagements  
     - Key stakeholder questions and discovery items

  2. **Discovery Phase**  
     - Stakeholder workshop questions  
     - Documentation requests (network diagrams, existing tooling)

  3. **Use Case Development**  
     - Mapping attack vectors using MITRE ATT&CK  
     - Defining deception techniques and targets  
     - Example ‚ÄúCyber Lure‚Äù threat use cases

  4. **Tooling Selection**  
     - Evaluating existing security tools for deception features  
     - Comparison of open source vs. commercial solutions  
     - Success criteria and cost breakdown considerations

  5. **Implementation Phases**  
     - Proof of Concept (POC) in Azure Sandbox  
     - Pilot deployment planning and timelines  
     - Wider production rollout across network segments

  6. **Key Deliverables**  
     - Tool comparison deliverable  
     - Use case coverage matrix  
     - Cost and implementation timelines

  7. **Example Network Diagrams**  
     - Cloud and on-prem decoy placements  
     - Honeypot types (SMB, AD, Citrix, endpoints, etc.)

## üöÄ How to Use This Deck  

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/honeypot-blueprint.git
   cd honeypot-blueprint
   ```

2. **Open the presentation**  
   - Launch `Honeypot-Blueprint.pptx` in Microsoft PowerPoint or any compatible viewer.  
   - Review each section in sequence, starting from discovery to implementation phases.

3. **Tailor to Client Needs**  
   - Use the stakeholder questions as a template for discovery workshops.  
   - Customize MITRE ATT&CK mappings based on your client‚Äôs threat profile.  
   - Adjust tooling comparisons and cost estimates to reflect current market offerings.

4. **Follow Implementation Phases**  
   - Begin with a POC in a controlled sandbox environment.  
   - Document pilot results and refine use cases before full deployment.  
   - Leverage example network diagrams to place decoys effectively.
